        was established under the Human Resources Development Project in
        Engineering, Technology, and Innovation, as outlined in a Cabinet
        resolution on December 4, 2018. This initiative aims to enhance the
        capabilities of Thailand's industrial sector and aligns with the
        Thailand 4.0 policy, particularly targeting the Eastern Economic
        Corridor (EEC). The project focuses on developing skilled human
        resources in science, technology, and innovation to support both
        existing and emerging industries, ultimately fostering innovative
        advancements in the country.

        The Thai government has partnered with the Japanese government,
        facilitating investment from foreign companies, including those from
        Japan, through a government loan project that emphasizes educational
        assistance. The KOSEN Institute of KMITL operates under the supervision
        of the Thai-KOSEN Institute, with a minister as the chairman of its
        executive board, ensuring compliance with the agreements established
        between the two countries.
        <span class="separator"></span>
        To align its academic offerings with Japan's KOSEN Institutes, KMITL has
        entered a cooperation agreement with NIT (National Institute of
        Technology) Japan. This includes the development of a curriculum that
        mirrors the Main Core Curriculum (MCC) used in Japan's KOSEN Institutes.
        As part of this collaboration, NIT is providing expert faculty members
        to serve as models and assist in training Thai faculty in mathematics,
        science, engineering, and technology, adhering to the KOSEN educational
        model from Japan.
