      This is the minisite for KOSEN-KMITL (KOSEN at King Mongkut's Institute of
      Technology Ladkrabang).

        >The KOSEN Institute of King Mongkut's Institute of Technology
        Ladkrabang (KOSEN - KMITL)</b
      >was established under the Human Resources Development Project in
      Engineering, Technology, and Innovation, as outlined in a Cabinet
      resolution on December 4, 2018. This initiative aims to enhance the
      capabilities of Thailand's industrial sector and aligns with the Thailand
      4.0 policy, particularly targeting the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC).
      The project focuses on developing skilled human resources in science,
      technology, and innovation to support both existing and emerging
      industries, ultimately fostering innovative advancements in the country.
      <br />
      <br />
      The Thai government has partnered with the Japanese government,
      facilitating investment from foreign companies, including those from
      Japan, through a government loan project that emphasizes educational
      assistance. The KOSEN Institute of KMITL operates under the supervision of
      the Thai-KOSEN Institute, with a minister as the chairman of its executive
      board, ensuring compliance with the agreements established between the two
      countries.
      <br />
      <br />
      To align its academic offerings with Japan's KOSEN Institutes, KMITL has
      entered a cooperation agreement with NIT (National Institute of
      Technology) Japan. This includes the development of a curriculum that
      mirrors the Main Core Curriculum (MCC) used in Japan's KOSEN Institutes.
      As part of this collaboration, NIT is providing expert faculty members to
      serve as models and assist in training Thai faculty in mathematics,
      science, engineering, and technology, adhering to the KOSEN educational
      model from Japan.
